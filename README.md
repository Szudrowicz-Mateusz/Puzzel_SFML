# Puzzel_SFML

My gf was playing some weird game on steam and I thought that I will create my own version of it.
Game logic was very easy. You had diffrent size texture and every puzzel had to fit  in the square.
So that's mine version with mine textures and worse colors.

Cmake to run this program:
  1)mkdir build
  2)cd build
  3)cmake ..
  4)make
  5)./p
